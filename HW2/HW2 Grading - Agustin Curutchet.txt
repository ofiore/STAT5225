Hi Owen,

As far as I understand, your overall numeric assessment for HW2 is a 3.
I think that you should check the following:

Problem 1: You forget to creat a permanet data set. Remeber that you have to do it with the LIBNAME function.

Problem 2:
-You forgot to save the matrix in an Rdata file in a.
-You forgot  to save the data frame in an Rdata file in b.
-You forgot to save the workspace in c.
-You didn't load the Rdata in d.

Problem 6: You forgot to save the list.

Problem 7: You forgot to save the data as the type listed; Gender as a factor and Credit History as Ordinal.

Best,
