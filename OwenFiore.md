## About Me
My name is **Owen Fiore** and I am a senior data science major.  In my free time I 
enjoy spending time with my friends, running, playing basketball, and staying 
active.  I am looking forward to this class and learning SAS and SQL and 
improving my skills in R.  
- I am probably going to attend UConn next year to get my Masters in Data Science as well.
